The analysis revealed insights such as the average star rating, common traveler types, high-rated flight routes, and customer willingness to recommend the airline.

									<p>Jumia-Tech is a large supplier of consumer hardware devices such as laptops, tablets, printers,

										customers can purchase items online and have it delivered to their home or delivered to the nearest
										Jumia-Tech store.The current process for handling online sales pickup at Jumia-Tech stores involves customers receiving notifications about their items' arrival, visiting the store, waiting in line, verifying their identity and tracking number, and then receiving their items from the customer service.Because of the pandemic and social distancing requirements the store can no longer have long lines
										for customer service. How can they still provide a good service for their customers who makes purchases online and need to receive the item quickly? We are finding a covid-safe way to help customers pickup their items that are purchased online. I designed a new workflow that will demonstrate the new processes.

									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/Unilever.PNG" alt="" /></a>
									<p>Unilever is a British-Dutch MNC FMCG company, headquartered in London,

										available in around 190 countries. In its UK offices, Unilever had around 1500
										employees which were spread across 12 floors.
										With two canteens seating 150 employees each, lunchtime congestion is a
										significant issue, resulting in wasted time and food. Employees spend excessive
										time queuing for meals, with limited options and insufficient time to enjoy their
										lunches. To address these issues, employees have proposed an online meal
										ordering system for delivery to their workstations, aiming to optimize lunch
										breaks and minimize food wastage.</p>
